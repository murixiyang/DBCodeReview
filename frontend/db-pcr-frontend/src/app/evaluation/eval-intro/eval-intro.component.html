  <h1>Welcome to the DB Code Review Study</h1>
  <p>
    Thank you for volunteering to participate in our code-review evaluation.
    <br />
    Your feedback will help us understand how different review conditions affect
    reviewer behavior and the author experience.
  </p>
  <h2>Before Starting</h2>
  <p>
    You will need to register an account to participate in this study.
    <br />
    We are using a self-hosted Gitlab so the normal gitlab account you hold
    won't work. Please register a new one.
  </p>

  <h2>Overview of Activities</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Optional Authoring Phase</strong> (≈15 min)<br />
      If you choose, you may write a short real-world coding snippet. Your code
      might be reviewed by other participants in the next phase and you’ll
      receive the comments from the reviewers.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Peer-Review Rounds</strong> (2 × 5~10 min)<br />
      You will review two different code snippets, giving comments to them.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Reviewer Survey</strong> (≈5 min)<br />
      After both review rounds, you will complete a short questionnaire about
      your experience. Your identity can be omitted from reports or
      presentations upon request — just let us know.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h2>What We will Do with Your Responses</h2>
  <p>
    We will collect your written code, review comments and survey responses for
    research purposes.
